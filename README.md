# Rat-radiation-resistance
A Cellranger/Seurat analysis of non-resistant and resistant AR42J rat cell lines. 

To run this analysis I created a custom rat genome (rn6) from Ensembl usng cellranger and then ran the standard single cell RNA-Seq pipeline. Seurat analysis was also standard with the additon of the cell cycle being regressed out.
